Rcpp98: Alternative implementation of the Rcpp API. 
====================================

## Installation

Until `Rcpp98` is released to CRAN, you can install it from github. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("romainfrancois/Rcpp98")
```

To install from source, ensure you have a 
[complete package development environment](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites).
